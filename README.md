🚀 Deployment Architecture
Local Development
bash
# Run backend
python app.py

# Access frontend
open index.html  # Or serve via local web server
Render Deployment
Docker-based deployment

Automatic dependency installation

Port configuration (1000)

WebSocket support enabled

⚙️ Configuration
Environment Variables
python
PORT = 1000  # Default port for Render compatibility
Dependencies (requirements.txt)
Flask: Web framework

Flask-SocketIO: WebSocket support

Flask-CORS: Cross-origin requests

Eventlet: Async server for Socket.IO

🎮 Usage Workflow
1. User Connects
Frontend establishes WebSocket connection

Terminal displays connection status

Editor is ready for code input

2. Code Execution
python
# User writes code in editor
print("Hello World")
name = input("Enter name: ")
3. Real-time Interaction
User clicks "Run Interactive"

Backend creates isolated process

Output streams to terminal in real-time

Terminal waits for user input when needed

4. Session Management
Multiple sessions supported

Proper cleanup on disconnect

Process termination on stop

🔒 Security Features
Execution Safety
Isolated Processes: Each session runs in separate process

Temporary Workspaces: Automatic cleanup of code files

Input Sanitization: Basic input validation

Resource Limits: Process timeout handling

Web Security
CORS Configuration: Controlled cross-origin access

WebSocket Validation: Session-based communication

Error Handling: Graceful failure management

📊 Performance Considerations
Scalability
Stateless Design: Session-based, no shared state

Process Isolation: Independent execution environments

Resource Management: Automatic cleanup prevents leaks

Optimization
Efficient Output Streaming: Line-by-line output for real-time feel

WebSocket Efficiency: Minimal overhead for real-time communication

Memory Management: Proper process termination
